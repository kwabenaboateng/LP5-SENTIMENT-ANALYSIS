# P5 - Sentiment Analysis (Text Classification)

![Sample Image](sentiment app.jpg)<br>

In this project, the concept of transfer learning was employed to fine tune novel Text Classifier models hosted on hugging faces (Xlnet-Bert-Cased, cardiffnlp/twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment and bert-base-uncased). The fine tuned model was pushed unto hugging faces and used to build an interactive application using streamlit.
